#download the cleaned data for this github: https://github.com/mokjud/education/blob/main/ksh_15.1.1.37_meteorological_data_of_hungary_and_budapest.csv and
#df <- read.csv("the_folder_you_saved_it/ksh_15.1.1.37_meteorological_data_of_hungary_and_budapest.csv")

#or use R to download it directly from the github

This is an example to do data reports in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).  
Our data comes from the [KHS](https://www.ksh.hu/). You can download the original dataset from [here](https://www.ksh.hu/stadat_files/kor/en/kor0037.html).  


This is a dataset about meteorological data of Hungary and Budapest.  

Here is a nice pic about a baby sloth enjoying the weather of Budapest. It's also show how you can add inline figure from webpages.  
`r include_graphics("https://www.zoobudapest.com/uploads/collection/1/image/lajharkolyok07%20foto%20Bagosi%20Zoltan.JPG")`


Let's look at the data!  

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=360,  eval=T}
# this is a code chunk in R

# kable() will create a nice table  
kable(head(df))
kable(head(df), col.names = c("year", "mean temp", "precipitation", "number of rainy days", "sunshine duration", "number of frosty days", "number of heat days", "number of hot flash days", "location"))
```

Now let's try a plot!  

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=360, eval=T}
ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = number_of_hot_flash_days, color = location))+ 
  theme_bw()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "number of hot flash days")
```

Use inline coding!  
The highest mean temperature in Budapest was `r max(filter(df, location == "Budapest")$mean_temperature, na.rm=T)` at the year of `r df$year[which(filter(df, location == "Budapest")$mean_temperature == max(filter(df, location == "Budapest")$mean_temperature, na.rm=T))]`.
